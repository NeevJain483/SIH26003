# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

The repository uses the root `.env` file for both the backend and Expo frontend.
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` at the repository root and set `DATABASE_URL`,
`JWT_SECRET`, and `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`. The Expo config loads the root file
through `app.config.js` and preserves the app settings in `app.json`, so start
Expo from the `frontend` workspace after changing environment values.

For a physical phone, `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` must use the computer's Wi-Fi/LAN
IPv4 address, not `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or a WSL/Hyper-V adapter address.
Connect the phone and computer to the same Wi-Fi network, allow Node.js through
the Windows firewall on that network, and verify that
`http://<computer-lan-ip>:4000/health` opens on the phone. Restart Expo with
`npx expo start -c` after changing the value because the API URL is bundled
when the development client starts.

If the phone is on mobile data or a Wi-Fi network that cannot reach the
computer, connect it by USB with USB debugging enabled and run
`adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081`. Start Expo with `npx expo start --lan`, then
open `exp://127.0.0.1:8081` in Expo Go. This forwards the frontend bundle over
USB; API requests still need a reachable backend.

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
